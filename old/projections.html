            Maple and Vine presented a unique set of challenges. In addition to the typical design elements, the show was performed entirely in Sign Language, requiring over 2000 lines of captions during the show. In order to make it easier for audience members who do not sign, the captions were projected in places that would provide easy sight lines for the audience, depending on where the performers were staged.
